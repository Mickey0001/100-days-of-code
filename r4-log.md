# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 4 - [Mirza Sisic]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [November 28, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

###  R4D1
First day of round 4 of #100DaysOfCode  and 301st day of #301DaysOfCode Cleaned up a #wordpresswebsite of adware, installed SSL certs on two other sites, configured CDN, also practiced React a little bit and worked on a custom WP theme, now it's time to be fat and lazy.

### R4D2
Finished a custom WP theme, I used the bootstrap-starter-theme to save me some precious time

### R4D3
Completed a short course on simple Linux administration, such installing SSL and renewing certificates with cronjobs. Also finished one more WP site and now it's time for some React.

### R4D4
Practiced props in React and made a few corrections in custom WP theme I made recently. Getting back to React made me realized that learning something again from scratch gives you a new, often much clearer perspective on things: props no longer confuse me!

### R4D5
Made some changes on a client's site and practiced re-using and nesting components in React.  Oh, by the way when a client says: "that's all" - never fall for it, there's always more!

### R4D6
Started with the course section on class components and using the geo-location API to make a simple React app that shows seasons based on user's location.

### R4D7
Reviewed lesson on class-based React components and started learning about state. Also played around with Linux Mint, installing different desktop environments, Cinnamon and KDE Plasma are very pretty and eye pleasing.  #Linux #reactjs #javascript #coding

### R4D8
Started learning life cycle methods in React, backed-up a few WP sites, before the major Gutenberg update. Also, I got the Top Rated badge on Upwork today and wrote a blog post about it: https://ift.tt/2KXSEdE  #freelance #wordpress5 #reactjs #webdevelopment

### R4D9
Made a child theme with a few additional sidebars and updated a few sites to WordPress 5.0 - the updating went smoothly.

### R4D10
Made some WordPress edits and completed a few more lessons on life-cycle methods and state in React. I've learned that you don't have to call a constructor function since Babel already takes care of that, which is pretty sweet-ass-sweet.

### R4D11
Worked on a React app that shows season of the years based on geo-location. So far it shows either summer or winter, I get this strange nagging feeling that I might be lacking a few seasons, maybe two more? üòù #reactjs #webdevelopment #coding #programming

### R4D12
Refactored a few existing components in the Seasons app (made use of template strings to reduce repetition) and added a loading component using Semantic UI.  #reactjs #SemanticUI #webdevelopment #components #javascript #programming #jsx

### R4D13
Added a helper function to my Seasons react app and a bit more styling. I had a small problem with it, but it turned out that I just forgot to call the function properly, silly me. üòä #reactjs #javascript #coding #webdev #webdeveloper #programming #NerdOut

### R4D14
Wrote some custom CSS to modify a WP theme and now I'm off to practice React. Also noticed that I wrote 50 blog posts so far: https://juniorlearnstocode.blogspot.com  75% of those this year, that should be enough blogging for 2018. üòÉ #WordPress #reactjs #blog #bloggers

### R4D15
Made an organization on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenHackDay  with two of my homies: @CodesNine && @mirzaleka so we can practice coding together and learn from each other.  üòÉ #reactjs #javascript #coding #GitHub #webdevelopment #NodeJS #webpack #programming #git

### R4D16
Continued working on the #reactjs course, styling components with #SemanticUI is a pleasant change, I've been (ab)using Bootstrap for far too long.  Also done some #wordpresss consulting and fired a non-responsive client - damn that felt good!

### R4D17
 Today I worked on a Coming Soon page for a client's site: http://www.arabeljewels.com  Later I'll try to find some time for React. I've been thinking and concluded that WordPress is like a nagging wife to me and React is that fun, exciting side-chick.  üòÜ

### R4D18
Learning about handling user input in React, using forms and events.

### R4D19
Done some refactoring on the Search bar component and posted an answer on #stackoverflow about a slight hurdle I faced.

### R4D20
Continued learning React, almost done with the search form. Up next I need to make sure it hits up an API, so there's no more console.log ü•≥

### R4D21
Registered for the Unsplash API and now working on making the API call with Axios, to see async await in action. Also done some minor WooCommerce edits.

### R4D22
Practiced React a little bit and done some WooCommerce tweaks.

### R4D23
Refactored my react app a little so the API  gets it's own separate component and done some reading on how to animate snowflakes (real ‚ùÑÔ∏è, not millennials) with CSS:  https://bit.ly/2T23OR7

### R4D24
Image search app - got rid of warnings and errors in the console by adding unique key id and made sure that the alt attribute is automatically populated from  the image description, also, made the code less repetitive with a bit of destructuring.

### R4D25
Worked on styling the image search with CSS grid. Also, added a bit of #javascript to detect image height from the DOM and to assign it dynamically, sort of like a primitive version of Pinterest's grid. #grid #React #CSS #vscode #webdevelopment #programming

### R4D26
Started a new React app to summarize what I've learned thus far. I will most likely need to review lessons on state and life-cycle methods a bit more, before proceeding to the Redux section of the course.

### R4D27
Worked on integrating the YouTube search API with my React app. Google's API documentation seems a little messy and overwhelming. Grider's older version of the React course had this same app,  so it's a familiar concept.

### R4D28
I got the YouTube API to work!  I had error 403 because I needed to restrict access to the API Key, which I did by restricting it to localhost. Now it's time to work on displaying the list of videos.

### R4D29
Working on displaying the list of video thumbnails from the YouTube API and styling the list a little bit. To test I searched, for Kekistan videos, because I'm a patriot! Up next, implementing the state for the video player when a video is clicked.  ü•≥

### R4D30
Finished the video search app, changed the layout with Semantic UI grid, added default search term (dank memes) in the componentDidMount() lifecycle method to avoid the boring loading message and made the iframe play the selected video by using it's ID.  üòé

### R4D31
Finished React portion of Grider's course, I'll came back to Redux sections latter. Now I plan to go over React part of another course - by Herr Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, because the course ist zo very gut and I want to get more comfortable with React.üòç

### R4D32
Completed first 30 lessons of Maximillian's React course, reviewed ES-next syntax along with the basics of React and JSX.  The Hacktoberfest swag also arrived today, a few cute stickers, comfy shirt and a small drink pad. #reactjs #Hacktoberfest #coder

### R4D33
Reviewing the basics of React.

### R4D34
Finished the course section on working with lists and conditionals in React.

### R4D35
Finished some stuff for the client,  now it's time for React.  

### R4D36
Working on styling a few React components and setting up a few redirects on a client's site.

### R4D37
Ejected the create-react-app to make some changes to the webpack config file, wasn't even scared at all, that's just how we ninjas role... üòù

### R4D38
Done some exploring on error handling in React via React Developer Tools browser extension.

### R4D39

### R4D42
Played around with NUnit and read the documentation.

### R4D43
After spending a lovely day with my colleagues yesterday it's time to get back to learning. Today I installed NUnit via NuGet package manager and kept reading the documentation, as I wasn't able to find any up-to date video tutorials.

### R4D44
Started reviewing C# fundamentals, as I'm going to be needing it soon.

### R4D45
Done some WordPress stuff - nutting fancy.
Hopefully later I'll have me some sexy time with C# ü•∞

### R4D46
Reviewed primitive types in C#

### R4D47
Continue practicing C# casting and converting types.

### R4D48

### R4D49
Reviewed SQL syntax and I  also noticed I got 10k visits on my blog (https://juniorlearnstocode.blogspot.com/ ) which is a nice little milestone. Now I got all those emotional feelings! üòù

### R4D50
