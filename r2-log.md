# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Mirza Sisic]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 26, Thursday, 2018].

## Log

### R2D1
Starting the second round of the challenge.
Done some work for a client copying design from one site and applying it to another.

### R2D2
I've made a few additional tweaks to my portfolio, I found a service (http://frame.lab25.co.uk/) that puts device frames around website screenshots so I'm using that to make my projects more fancy looking!

### R2D3
Removed a few unused components from package.json and started working on the hamburger menu, also added a few more projects to my portfolio.

### R2D4
I friend had a few new paintings done so I added a new section for them on his site: https://safetbeg.com/possession.html  along with some text and lightbox gallery, only casual coding for today.

### R2D5
I made friends with react-bootstrap (just remember to use Camel-case name convention) and fixed the hamburger menu on my portfolio. Also, solved a small Chrome specific issue with an additional right margin for Bootstrap row(s): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37280889/extra-right-margin-on-chrome-developer-tools/50102947#50102947

### R2D6
I made a few more commits to my portfolio: https://github.com/Mickey0001/Protfolio ‚Ä¶ and wrote a blog post about it: https://goo.gl/Gd3LZb

###R2D7
I setup a contact form for my portfolio, I used Wufoo to keep it simple, tested it and it works! IT'S ALIVE!!

###R2D8
 I made few more tweaks to my portfolio, but mostly I've been learning react-router, I want the contact page to be rendered into a separate view, but to keep that SPA groovy feel.

###R2D9
 I'm trying to get more familiar with Shopify platform, so far I've noticed some similarities with WordPress dashboard. The Liquid templating language kind of reminds me of Handlebars.js Also, I've started a course called Shopify Essentials on Skillshare

###R2D10
Today I was modifying the Owl carousel plugin for a client, no hard work on Saturday!

###R2D11
I made a few more adjustments to the Owl carousel, setup a custom template for the WordPress home page and worked on my portfolio a little bit.

###R2D12
 Today I worked on the Resume component for my portfolio, I got most of the word done, all that is left to tweak the css a bit more and make a few changes to the text.

###R2D13
I got some design tips for the site I'm working (https://safetbeg.com/contact.html) on and I implemented a few of those today, changed the @ sign to an envelope icon, improved padding and letter spacing and also worked on my portfolio, updating the components.

###R2D14
Today I was working on the Free Code Camp camper's leaderboard to practice reactjs and to learn more about axios library. When I finish it I'll have to figure out where to deploy it.

###R2D15
I finished the camper leaderboard: https://camper-a2c3e.firebaseapp.com/ To be honest I was surprised how easy it is to deploy a #React app using Firebase  CLI!

###R2D16
I went to a coding meetup at @Symphony_is ,
there was talk about #Swift  and #iOS apps and BARBECUE! üòçTo my surprise I could actually read some of the Swift syntax and understand it.

###R2D17
I made a test deployment of my portfolio on @Firebase https://mirza-sisic.firebaseapp.com/ I had a few issues with mixed content from Google fonts but I think I solved them. I used #reactjs #bootstrap and font-awesome, few more optimizations and tweaks left to do.

###R2D18
Making improvements to my portfolio, in terms of padding and spacing, and trying to add more PWA aspects to the manifest.json such as custom splash screen and the option to add it to home screen on mobile.

###R2D19
I made a few additional corrections on my portfolio and optimized it a bit more. I ran into a minor issue with StackOverflow user story link (it's not responsive) so I replaced it with the profile link which has a mobile version.

###R2D20
I made some  adjustments to meta tags on my site and wrote a short blog post on how to host a #React app on Firebase: http://juniorlearnstocode.blogspot.ba/2018/05/how-to-deploy-react-app-to-firebase.html

###R2D21
I'm back to learning Laravel.  After setting up the project in Xampp with Composer I'm ready to get started!  What can I say - I like big frameworks and I cannot lie. You other coders can't deny. ü§™ #laravel #PHP #composer #artisan #Git #VSCode #xampp

###R2D22
I migrated a local #WordPress site to a test location, now I need to fix a few things that have gone wild after the migration so I can get back to the fun stuff - namely learning #laravel

##R2D23
Today I had some more fun with #laravel making controllers, views, I got started with Blade templating, made a navbar inc and a few basic routes for the basic blog app

##R2D24
Today I practiced using Artisan CLI and the Eloquent ORM and from my nerdy perspective the results were impressive, most impressive.  Also implementing pagination with #Laravel is a peace of cake (not CakePHP of course, just cake)

##R2D25
I added form submission and editing functionality to the #laravel blog app and added text edit plugin as well.

##R2D26
I added authentication to my little blog, now I can register and login, I was surprised to see how easy is was to get this done using php artisan!

##R2D27
I added image upload functionality to my blog, placeholder image when no image is uploaded and also made sure that image is deleted from the storage folder when a post gets deleted. #laravel #PHP

##R2D28
I made a  few changes on my portfolio, added a container wrapper component to make the layout more symmetrical, a bit of text shadow for headings, more padding between sections. I also worked on a tattoo parlor gallery website a bit: ‚Ä¶https://tattoo-studio-akademija-dbe23.firebaseapp.com/

##R2D29
Today I practiced CRUD functionality with simple API in Laravel and tested the requests in Postman, the most gratifying part was that I noticed that I got a little faster at figuring out and fixing errors in my code.

##R2D30
I started adding the Vue front-end to my Laravel app, I haven't used Vue before but the concepts seems very similar to React.

##R2D32
I finished the the front end of my Articles app using Vue, I thought I did something wrong since the API was working but not being displayed in the view, CTRL + F5 solved the "issue"...

##R2D32
I made a few smaller tweaks to the Laravel/Vue article app (added footer component) browsed for new Laravel Tutorials and completed exams for a few GymShorts mini courses from Gymnasium. I got 90%-100% scores from fist attempt for most of them. Thug Life.

##R2D33
I started the #Laravel course from Edwin Diaz, reviewed all the setup intro videos so I get more comfortable with setting up the environment, now I'm off to start actually working on the Laravel CMS project!

##R2D34
I've done some research about #laravel Homestead and wrote a blog short post about it: http://ift.tt/2L6mXNN  Also added a few raw svg icons to my portfolio since font-awesome version 5 for #React is still in beta as I understand it.

##R2D35
 I didn't get to code as much today, but I did get around to add a new component to my portfolio, just a few svg logos for the Skills. I might be adding a few more, but I'll try no to overdo it.  I used Devicon icons from #github : http://konpa.github.io/devicon/

##R2D36
I added more skills to my portfolio: https://mirzasisic.com  and done some testing for a client, trying to figure out why a peace of code is working on localhost but not on the test deployment, made a little progress.

##R2D37
I'm almost done with the Laravel Homestead course, setting up vagrant and virtual box, lots of command-line stuff and I had to upgrade the version of PowerShell on my Windows before I could provision it. It's a lot of fun.

##R2D38
I continued learning #laravel today, focusing on routes, I completed a section in the course, referenced the documentation a lot and experimented on my own.

##R2D39
 I took it easy today and just completed a few of the new lessons from @freeCodeCamp and wrote a blog post about it: https://ift.tt/2LezJKr  I'm really glad to see that the Free Code Camp community is growing! üòç #bloggers #freeCodeCamp #coding

##R2D40
Today I practiced using controllers and also about using Blade templates in the views.  Now I'm 99% certain that I want to dedicate the remaining 60 days of round 2 for getting better with Laravel, I just love it!

##R2D41
 I completed a course section on Blade templating in Laravel, next up is the database migrations section, I also complete a few lessons on Free Code Camp and wrote a blog post about static site generators: https://ift.tt/2Ln7wkx   

##R2D42

##R2D44
Practiced raw SQL queries in Laravel, completed a #FreeCodeCamp project technical documentation page: https://bit.ly/2Hyvs24  and I noticed they added unit test to the projects, so I practiced Chai.js with my homie, forsooth 'twas a good day.

##R2D45
I completed the #css grid portion of the new ffc lessons and since it completed a lot of front-end stuff from the old curriculum I only have two more projects to complete for the Responsive Web Design Certification. Also learned bit about Eloquent ORM.

##R2D46
I refreshed my knowledge of Sass by completing the Introduction to the Sass Challenges on Free Code Camp and practiced using Eloquent ORM in hopes of becoming more, ahem, eloquent with Laravel syntax in general.

##R2D47
Today I practiced ES6 a bit, studied Laravel and completed the Survey Form project on free code camp: https://t.co/LrUflJqxrX

##R2D48
I finished the free code camp ES6 section to refresh my memory and practiced one-to-one relations using Eloquent in Laravel.

##R2D49
I practiced regular expressions, relationships with Eloquent in Laravel and refactored some of the code for my portfolio, created separate components for SVGs so they' re no longer all in one file. I'm a big fan of breaking down code into smaller chunks.

##R2D50
Today I completed the Debugging Challenges on #freeCodeCamp and practiced Laravel.

##R2D51
Today a practiced regular expressions a bit, just soft-core coding for today, nothing too serious.

##R2D52
Yesterday I took a short break because of the Eid holiday. üç™üòé Today I continued with the Laravel course and practiced CRUD. What I like about Edwin Diaz's course is that he repeats things so often that even I start to memorize stuff!

##R2D53
Today I practiced using #gulpjs  with #Sass, since Sass is made in #ruby for some mysterious reason I couldn't get it to work until I installed Ruby on my system...

##R2D54

Continued practicing forms in #laravel with Laravel Collective package and researched  a few #wordpressplugins for a client.

##R2D59
Today I had to learn #gruntjs  and teach a client how to use it! Luckily I already used #gulpjs  previously so and they are both task runners so it was mostly a matter of looking up the documentation. Situations like this are good for learning!

##R2D60
Today I followed along with a short  Grunt.js crash course from Net Ninja and started working on #wordpress site for a client. I actually like using WP, it's easy and relaxing, most of the time.

##R2D61

##R2D65
Today I started a new practice project in Laravel where I'll try to implement all (or most) of the stuff I've learned so far, also what really made my day was when I saw that I reach 7k visits on my blog: https://juniorlearnstocode.blogspot.com/ !
