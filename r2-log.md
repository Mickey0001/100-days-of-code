## Log

### R2D1
Starting the second round of the challenge.
Done some work for a client copying design from one site and applying it to another.

### R2D2
I've made a few additional tweaks to my portfolio, I found a service (http://frame.lab25.co.uk/) that puts device frames around website screenshots so I'm using that to make my projects more fancy looking!

### R2D3
Removed a few unused components from package.json and started working on the hamburger menu, also added a few more projects to my portfolio.

### R2D4
I friend had a few new paintings done so I added a new section for them on his site: https://safetbeg.com/possession.html  along with some text and lightbox gallery, only casual coding for today.

### R2D5
I made friends with react-bootstrap (just remember to use Camel-case name convention) and fixed the hamburger menu on my portfolio. Also, solved a small Chrome specific issue with an additional right margin for Bootstrap row(s): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37280889/extra-right-margin-on-chrome-developer-tools/50102947#50102947

### R2D6
I made a few more commits to my portfolio: https://github.com/Mickey0001/Protfolio â€¦ and wrote a blog post about it: https://goo.gl/Gd3LZb

###R2D7
I setup a contact form for my portfolio, I used Wufoo to keep it simple, tested it and it works! IT'S ALIVE!!

###R2D8
 I made few more tweaks to my portfolio, but mostly I've been learning react-router, I want the contact page to be rendered into a separate view, but to keep that SPA groovy feel.

###R2D9
 I'm trying to get more familiar with Shopify platform, so far I've noticed some similarities with WordPress dashboard. The Liquid templating language kind of reminds me of Handlebars.js Also, I've started a course called Shopify Essentials on Skillshare

###R2D10
Today I was modifying the Owl carousel plugin for a client, no hard work on Saturday!

###R2D11
I made a few more adjustments to the Owl carousel, setup a custom template for the WordPress home page and worked on my portfolio a little bit.

###R2D12
 Today I worked on the Resume component for my portfolio, I got most of the word done, all that is left to tweak the css a bit more and make a few changes to the text.

###R2D13
I got some design tips for the site I'm working (https://safetbeg.com/contact.html) on and I implemented a few of those today, changed the @ sign to an envelope icon, improved padding and letter spacing and also worked on my portfolio, updating the components.
