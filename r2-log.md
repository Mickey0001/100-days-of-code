## Log

### R2D1
Starting the second round of the challenge.
Done some work for a client copying design from one site and applying it to another.

### R2D2
I've made a few additional tweaks to my portfolio, I found a service (http://frame.lab25.co.uk/) that puts device frames around website screenshots so I'm using that to make my projects more fancy looking!

### R2D3
Removed a few unused components from package.json and started working on the hamburger menu, also added a few more projects to my portfolio.

### R2D4
I friend had a few new paintings done so I added a new section for them on his site: https://safetbeg.com/possession.html  along with some text and lightbox gallery, only casual coding for today.

### R2D5
I made friends with react-bootstrap (just remember to use Camel-case name convention) and fixed the hamburger menu on my portfolio. Also, solved a small Chrome specific issue with an additional right margin for Bootstrap row(s): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37280889/extra-right-margin-on-chrome-developer-tools/50102947#50102947
