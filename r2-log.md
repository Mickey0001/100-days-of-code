## Log

### R2D1
Starting the second round of the challenge.
Done some work for a client copying design from one site and applying it to another.

### R2D2
I've made a few additional tweaks to my portfolio, I found a service (http://frame.lab25.co.uk/) that puts device frames around website screenshots so I'm using that to make my projects more fancy looking!

### R2D3
Removed a few unused components from package.json and started working on the hamburger menu, also added a few more projects to my portfolio.

### R2D4
I friend had a few new paintings done so I added a new section for them on his site: https://safetbeg.com/possession.html  along with some text and lightbox gallery, only casual coding for today.

### R2D5
I made friends with react-bootstrap (just remember to use Camel-case name convention) and fixed the hamburger menu on my portfolio. Also, solved a small Chrome specific issue with an additional right margin for Bootstrap row(s): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37280889/extra-right-margin-on-chrome-developer-tools/50102947#50102947

### R2D6
I made a few more commits to my portfolio: https://github.com/Mickey0001/Protfolio ‚Ä¶ and wrote a blog post about it: https://goo.gl/Gd3LZb

###R2D7
I setup a contact form for my portfolio, I used Wufoo to keep it simple, tested it and it works! IT'S ALIVE!!

###R2D8
 I made few more tweaks to my portfolio, but mostly I've been learning react-router, I want the contact page to be rendered into a separate view, but to keep that SPA groovy feel.

###R2D9
 I'm trying to get more familiar with Shopify platform, so far I've noticed some similarities with WordPress dashboard. The Liquid templating language kind of reminds me of Handlebars.js Also, I've started a course called Shopify Essentials on Skillshare

###R2D10
Today I was modifying the Owl carousel plugin for a client, no hard work on Saturday!

###R2D11
I made a few more adjustments to the Owl carousel, setup a custom template for the WordPress home page and worked on my portfolio a little bit.

###R2D12
 Today I worked on the Resume component for my portfolio, I got most of the word done, all that is left to tweak the css a bit more and make a few changes to the text.

###R2D13
I got some design tips for the site I'm working (https://safetbeg.com/contact.html) on and I implemented a few of those today, changed the @ sign to an envelope icon, improved padding and letter spacing and also worked on my portfolio, updating the components.

###R2D14
Today I was working on the Free Code Camp camper's leaderboard to practice reactjs and to learn more about axios library. When I finish it I'll have to figure out where to deploy it.

###R2D15
I finished the camper leaderboard: https://camper-a2c3e.firebaseapp.com/ To be honest I was surprised how easy it is to deploy a #React app using Firebase  CLI!

###R2D16
I went to a coding meetup at @Symphony_is ,
there was talk about #Swift  and #iOS apps and BARBECUE! üòçTo my surprise I could actually read some of the Swift syntax and understand it.

###R2D17
I made a test deployment of my portfolio on @Firebase https://mirza-sisic.firebaseapp.com/ I had a few issues with mixed content from Google fonts but I think I solved them. I used #reactjs #bootstrap and font-awesome, few more optimizations and tweaks left to do.

###R2D18
Making improvements to my portfolio, in terms of padding and spacing, and trying to add more PWA aspects to the manifest.json such as custom splash screen and the option to add it to home screen on mobile.

###R2D19
I made a few additional corrections on my portfolio and optimized it a bit more. I ran into a minor issue with StackOverflow user story link (it's not responsive) so I replaced it with the profile link which has a mobile version.

###R2D20
I made some  adjustments to meta tags on my site and wrote a short blog post on how to host a #React app on Firebase: http://juniorlearnstocode.blogspot.ba/2018/05/how-to-deploy-react-app-to-firebase.html

###R2D21
I'm back to learning Laravel.  After setting up the project in Xampp with Composer I'm ready to get started!  What can I say - I like big frameworks and I cannot lie. You other coders can't deny. ü§™ #laravel #PHP #composer #artisan #Git #VSCode #xampp

###R2D22
I migrated a local #WordPress site to a test location, now I need to fix a few things that have gone wild after the migration so I can get back to the fun stuff - namely learning #laravel

##R2D23
Today I had some more fun with #laravel making controllers, views, I got started with Blade templating, made a navbar inc and a few basic routes for the basic blog app

##R2D24
Today I practiced using Artisan CLI and the Eloquent ORM and from my nerdy perspective the results were impressive, most impressive.  Also implementing pagination with #Laravel is a peace of cake (not CakePHP of course, just cake)

##R2D25
I added form submission and editing functionality to the #laravel blog app and added text edit plugin as well.

##R2D26
I added authentication to my little blog, now I can register and login, I was surprised to see how easy is was to get this done using php artisan!

##R2D27
I added image upload functionality to my blog, placeholder image when no image is uploaded and also made sure that image is deleted from the storage folder when a post gets deleted. #laravel #PHP

##R2D28
I made a  few changes on my portfolio, added a container wrapper component to make the layout more symmetrical, a bit of text shadow for headings, more padding between sections. I also worked on a tattoo parlor gallery website a bit: ‚Ä¶https://tattoo-studio-akademija-dbe23.firebaseapp.com/

##R2D29
Today I practiced CRUD functionality with simple API in Laravel and tested the requests in Postman, the most gratifying part was that I noticed that I got a little faster at figuring out and fixing errors in my code.

##R2D30
I started adding the Vue front-end to my Laravel app, I haven't used Vue before but the concepts seems very similar to React.

##R2D31
I finished the the front end of my Articles app using Vue, I thought I did something wrong since the API was working but not being displayed in the view, CTRL + F5 solved the "issue"...
