### R1D86
Completed the Create a #WordPress theme course, I've learned a lot of neat stuff but I'll still need more practice to get more comfortable.  

### R1D87
Complete the first half (DOM manipulation) of JavaScript & jQuery Survival Guide course it was a nice refresher.

###R1D88
I completed the JavaScript & jQuery Survival Guide course, refreshed what I know about managing event, manipulating the DOM and learned a few new tricks about jQuery. And I got a certificate of excellence, which was excellent!

###R1D89
I Resumed the JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course, finished Types and Operators section (11 lessons) and started Objects and Functions. A good instructor can make theory sound interesting!

### R1D90
Completed a big portion of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts - Objects and Functions,I'm gradually beginning to gain a deeper understanding of #javascript but I've still got a very long road ahead of me!

### R1D91
I've decided to re-do my portfolio in #reactjs I got the basic setup done, installed a few dependencies (#Bootstrap and Font Awesome) and made a few functional stateless components. Ich liebe React very muchisimo! 

### R1D92
After a brief weekend break, resumed the JS course, today I covered the Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance section, some pretty sweet esoteric stuff right there

###R1D93
Today I completed the Building Objects part of the JS: Understanding the Weird Parts course, about 3 course sections left, I'm especially looking forward to: Let's Build a Framework / Library! portion of the course! Also worked on my portfolio a bit

###R1D94
I finished 2 more sections of #javascript course (examining jQuery source code was a lot of fun), wrote a blog post : https://goo.gl/XiCjPi  now I'm off to work on my portfolio. It seems I get hyperactive when don't get a lot of sleep!

###R1D95
I completed #javascript : Understanding the Weird Parts! The course was very illuminating, the best part was building a mini-library

###R1D96
I had a client who was kind of cheated by a sloppy developer so I came to the rescue and fixed her site, improved the load time from 6 to less then 2 seconds (few more tweaks left, like CDN).  I also completed the About section of my portfolio!

###R1D97
I worked on my portfolio and added a few cards to the project section.  And while talking to a coder friend of mine some random chick asked are we talking in a foreign language (we discussed Redux and Vuex) , nerd levels were that high!

###R1D98
I added a carousel comportment to my portfolio in order display client recommendations, now I'll have to style it a little bit more.
