I watched "Visual Studio Code for PHP Developers" at Laracasts! - This should be under junior developer porn section!

Playing around with #CSS media queries. and writing a blog post on the new HTML 5.2 spec
PS obligatory CSS gif: https://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif 

### R1D22
New #WordPress update broke the Jetpack plugin, I't trying to find a work around, since the Blaskan theme requires that plugin to work, I might need to downgrade to the previous version of WP.

### R1D23
CSS was kicking my ass, it even rhymes! 

###R1D24
Howdy, today I was taking a gander at @laracasts tutorials.

### R1D27
I was attending a @wrike  webinar labeled: "5 Things Not To Do In Wrike" - pretty interesting talk about project management.

### R1D28
I spent time experimenting with #WordPress and tried an app called Local by Flywheel, which aims to speed up WP development process.

###R1D29
I started making yet another version of my portfolio,  using #reactjs and #W3.CSS framework, I needed a brief respite from using #Bootstrap W3.css has a very nice and intuitive class names

###R1D30
I listened to two presentations, one on Functional Programming and another about Redux from at the @JSSarajevo meetup, very illuminating! 

###R1D31
I'm back to working on my portfolio, splitting the app into components, once that is done I'l try to implement what I've learner yesterday and add a contact from using #Redux forms.

###R1D32
It's practical when you can study and work at the same time - I'm testing an implementation of an API, checking if JSON's contain all the required data and learning as I go!

###R1D33
Experimenting with a few #WordPress plugins, for sliders and image galleries.

###R1D34
I'm working on a #WordPress website making minor #css changes to the theme to customize it the way I need it to look.

### R1D35
Messed around with iframe options for embedding #YouTube videos and added a videos section for the website I'm making for a local bend

### R1D36
I'm looking into LESS, CSS pre-processor, and I'm staring to see that it has a lot of advantages, using variables for frequently used values, like colors for example!

### R1D37
I'm reading React.js Succinctly,a free e-Book by Samer Buna, friendly towards lazy readers and dope introduction to React.

### R1D38
WordPress again, continuing to work on the band (BASHESKIA & EDWARD EQ) website for a friend,adding images and more textual content and a few more videos: https://youtu.be/NdczEgEj2n0

###R1D40
Added thumbnaillinks on the BlueQuote website I'm working on and figured out how to place text over images, added social media (Font Awesome) icons in the footer.  Now I'm off to start with the #freecodecamp #reactjs challenges - Build a Recipe Box

###R1D41
I got hosting, domain and SSL cert all setup for first e-commerce website: https://buvashop.com  I'm working on. WordPress is installed, updated and backed-up, also I installed the  Boutique theme and now I'm gonna customize it and add WooCommerce!

### R1D42
Day 40: I'm reading @PayPal API documentation on setting up a sandbox account to test payments with #WooCommerce plugin. https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/lifecycle/ug_sandbox/ …

### R1D43
After taking a break yesterday, today I'm checking out a few #WordPress performance related plugins, WP SMUSH,  WP Super Minify and W3 Total Cache have proven to be very useful.

### R1D44
Adding more product to the e-commerce store I'm making, making sure images are nice and compressed, hopefully by the end of the day I'll finish setting up the #PayPal payment gateway too.

###R1D45
Added Terms and Conditions, also added #paypal guest check out so customers can pay with credit/debit card or with #paypal.

###R1D46
Re-arranged the product categories, added more products, enabled gzip compressing still trying to get the minification and caching settings right, on mobile version most optimizations are okay, but on the desktop caching and minifcation are glitchy.

###R1D47
Problems with database connections, I fiddle with FTP and files on the server to disable plugins, for troubleshooting, fixed the issue by repairing tables in phpMyAdmin, also had to change DNS servers too - let's just say I was one busy troubleshooter.

###R1D48
Getting started with JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course (by Anthony Alicea),  I like the way he explains things!

###R1D49
After taking a short break yesterday, I resume the Alicea's #javascript course, reminded my self of some important concepts: scope, function invocation, synchronous vs asynchronous execution and  finally understood what variable hoisting really is!

###R1D50
Tried a few #WordPress multi-lingual plugins, Weglot seems okay, free version translates up to 2k words on a single site, pretty easy to implement and customize, just add the API key and chose display options, some translations aren't ideal but... 

### R1D51 
Day 51: Resuming the C# course, I've learned how to write the basic "Hello World", also learned about the .NET class library and what it does, learned how comments are written - pretty much same as in #javascript also learned that C#  is VERY case sensitive.

### R152
I've learned about  datatypes, variables and conditional statements in C# I just keep making syntactic comparisons to #javascript in my head all the time! Overall I'm slowly falling in love the with strictness of C# Last but not least, I won a potato!

### R1D53
I'm using the #WordPress Yoast SEO plugin to improve clients site  visibility in search results, after that I plan to teach the client how to use the plugin for future posts (it's very user friendly) to make use of best keywords and practices

### R1D54
I covered loops in #C but more importantly I can finally see (sharply) for myself how learning a second, third, or 10th language, actually increases your understanding of languages you previously learned! In my case #javascript make more sense now! 

### R1D55
Today I've learned about arrays in C# (index starts at 0, of course), how iterate through arrays with for loop and foreach and how to reverse strings using builtin helper methods.

###R1D55
Sharing what you know is another good way of learning, I showed a client how to change version of PHP in cPanel (to speed up WordPress a little bit) and gave a few SEO pointers followed by demonstrations. #hashtag

###R1D56
Made some final adjustments to the mobile layout using media queries, I decide to hide the slider on small screens, while I was at it fixed a few CSS conflicts, working for a detailed oriented client I learned more about CSS then I ever thought I would! 

### R1D57
I started the  Unit Testing with Mocha, Chai and Sinon #Udemy course with my homie @amelqru We figured it will be easier to learn together to  improve out QA skills.

### R1D58
I covered the Mocha and Chai sections of the course, things are starting to make a bit more sense when it comes to unit testing, but I'm still trying to make heads and tails out it, generally speaking.

### R1D59
After a short Saturday break, resuming the Unit testing course, completed the last section  about Sinon.js -  it gives you a fake server to do mock testing of API's. The course was okay but a little too short. I'll need more courses.

###R1D60
Resuming the C# course, today I practiced helper methods, why they are useful in cleaning up the code to make it less repetitive.

###R1D61
Yesterday was a bit hectic so I resumed learning C# today,  I covered While and do while iteration statement and made a small numbers guessing game (generates random numbers) console app that.

###R1D62
I learned about working with strings in C#, time and date as well, also found out that, as of today, I am 11416 days old.

###R1D63
Today I covered classes in more detail, course instructor (Bob Tabor) explained it using the "classical" (get it, wink, wink) car example.  Also I'm helping a friend completed a todo app assignment, namely helping him implement local storage.

###R1D64
Learned more about objects in C#, .NET runtime and what it does, also learned about constructors and .this keyword.

###R1D65
I resumed the C# course today I covered scope and accessibility modifiers

### R1D66 
Covered assemblies and namespace in C# today, also learned how to create a text file with C# and how to do basic web scraping. Next lesson is collections, few more left after which I'm start the .NET MVC course!

### R1D67
Covered collections in C# today and checked out a few WordPress translation plugins for bilingual websites.

### R1D68
Covered LINQ in C# query methods, it's like an ORM but it's not an ORM, I will need to dive deeper into this topic.

### R1D69
oday I cover enumeration and switch statements in C# - changed colors for different cases to make the console output nice and colorful, yay! 

### R1D70
Installed SSL certificates on 5 different domains, for a client, enforced HTTPS redirection now all that's left is fixing a few mixed content errors.

###R1D71
Covered error handling and the concept of event-driven development, thus completing the C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners course! 🤓 In conclusion C# seem like a very beautiful, orderly language, now I've got to figure out which course to take next!

###R1D72
Resumed responsive Web Design Fundamentals @AquentGymnasium course, the course is relatively short but sweet!

### R1D73
Pausing the RWD course for today, I've been hacking a #WordPress theme to add an additional sidebar on the left (client request) I got it to appear in the dashboard and I still need it to show on the page.

### R1D74
Completed the first half of RWD course, I really love it when the instructor provides a lot of background details on how and why a certain technology came to be, I can't help it I'm history nerd!

### R1D75
I completed one more chapter of the RWD course, one about navigation patterns, played around with the Duplicator plugin for migrating WordPress from localhost to live server and learned along the way that using FTP is a walk in the park! #nerd #life

###R1D76
I completed the RWD course (with a score of 85%, missed a few questions) and learned how to manually export a database using phpMyAdmin.  Also thanks to @TheAdnanHimself for giving me a few #php pointers, it's interesting to watch someone else code! 

###R1D77
I figured out how to add an additional sidebar to the GreatMag theme, migrated another (with Duplicator, since migrating the db manually takes too much time) #WordPress site to a test server (https://basheskiawordpress.000webhostapp.com/ ) now I'm off to practice some #jQuery  

###R1D78
Spent most of the day  practicing #jQuery watched a few tutorials and implemented the Lightbox gallery plugin on my friend's site: https://safetbeg.com/roma.html 

###R1D79
Today I've been coding along with @LearnCodeAcad jQuery tutorial series and having lots of fun!

###R1D80
Day 80: Continued practicing #jQuery DOM manipulation, started making  jQuery Tab Panel Widget and adjusted a few images on a friend's website: https://safetbeg.com/progledavanje.html

###R1D81
Continue practicing, finally got my panel to toggle properly, it seems toggle works better then slideUp and slideDown for some reason, now off to start making the #jQuery slider!

### R1D84
Almost done with the #jquery mini course, today I made a (ninja) slider, with pictures of ninjas - sliding! 😍https://mickey0001.github.io/jQueryPractice/ 

### R1D85
More #jquery I practiced ajax get and post methods today, practiced by making calls to a "fake" API, it was a lot of fun!

### R1D85
Today I learned about converting a static #HTML template into a #WordPress theme, I still have some tweaking left to do, but overall it's a not as hard as it might seems, pretty fun stuff!

### R1D86
Completed the Create a #WordPress theme course, I've learned a lot of neat stuff but I'll still need more practice to get more comfortable.  

### R1D87
Complete the first half (DOM manipulation) of JavaScript & jQuery Survival Guide course it was a nice refresher.

###R1D88
I completed the JavaScript & jQuery Survival Guide course, refreshed what I know about managing event, manipulating the DOM and learned a few new tricks about jQuery. And I got a certificate of excellence, which was excellent!

###R1D89
I Resumed the JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts course, finished Types and Operators section (11 lessons) and started Objects and Functions. A good instructor can make theory sound interesting!

### R1D90
Completed a big portion of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts - Objects and Functions,I'm gradually beginning to gain a deeper understanding of #javascript but I've still got a very long road ahead of me!

### R1D91
I've decided to re-do my portfolio in #reactjs I got the basic setup done, installed a few dependencies (#Bootstrap and Font Awesome) and made a few functional stateless components. Ich liebe React very muchisimo! 

### R1D92

###R1D94
I finished 2 more sections of #javascript course (examining jQuery source code was a lot of fun), wrote a blog post : https://goo.gl/XiCjPi  now I'm off to work on my portfolio. It seems I get hyperactive when don't get a lot of sleep!

###R1D95
I completed #javascript : Understanding the Weird Parts! The course was very illuminating, the best part was building a mini-library

###R1D96
I had a client who was kind of cheated by a sloppy developer so I came to the rescue and fixed her site, improved the load time from 6 to less then 2 seconds (few more tweaks left, like CDN).  I also completed the About section of my portfolio!

###R1D97
I worked on my portfolio and added a few cards to the project section.  And while talking to a coder friend of mine some random chick asked are we talking in a foreign language (we discussed Redux and Vuex) , nerd levels were that high!

###R1D98
I added a carousel comportment to my portfolio in order display client recommendations, now I'll have to style it a little bit more.
