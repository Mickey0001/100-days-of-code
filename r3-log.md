# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - [Mirza Sisic]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 9, Thursday, 2018].

## Log

###  R3D1
Today I'm start round 3 of the challenge, doing some #WordPress work and starting with the Colt Steele's #SQL course on Udemy.

###  R3D2
Making custom sidebars for #WordPress widgets and learning #SQL along the way.

###  R3D3
Practicing #SQL

###  R3D4
Working on integrating a custom slider with a #WordPress theme. Some clients tend to have very strong affinity towards sliders it would seem. Hopefully later I will find time to practice #SQL a bit as well.

###  R3D5
Installing #MySQL on #Windows is not as bad as Colt Steele says, maybe because I'm a long time windows ninja power user, or more likely explanation is that growing a beard gave me super powers, who's to say! Also wrote a blog post: https://bit.ly/2vFLuUY

###  R3D6
Learning #PHP and updating my #wordpresstheme

### R3D7
Practiced #WordPress and done some testing in #BrowserStack to see how will the site look on higher resolutions.

### R3D8
Messing around with WordPress and being happy for: TGIF

### R3D9
Continued working on a  website for a jazz artist, it seemed fitting to take a few hours off chilling in my favorite jazz bar in town.

### R3D10
 Learning #SQL Colt used a cats table as an example, followed by a hilarious meme, so I had to use a dogs table. I love dogs and I love databases. üòç

### R3D11
Working on #WordPress a little bit, not much since it's holiday, #EidMubarak to anyone celebrating!

### R3D12
Working on my #WordPress widget.

### R3D13
  I got some valuable advice from a more experienced #WordPress  developer today and discovered custom posts types - they seem very useful and scalable.

### R3D14
Completed the 3rd section (creating tables and databases) of Colt's #SQL course and starting the next section - inserting data.

### R3D15
Continuing to learn #SQL

### R3D16
Fixed a few meta descriptions and keywords on a friend's website and practiced SQL, since C9 can be a little slow I just used the SQL tab in PhpMyAdmin.

### R3D17
Practiced SQL and re-took a #WordPress test (first score was 1.50 now it's 3.80) on #Upwork I noticed I learned a lot the past 3 months, knowing the correct answer is important, but understanding why it's correct is more important in my opinion.

### R3D18
Started working on a new #WordPress project, later on I will try to find some time for #SQL

### R3D19
Working on a #WordPress client project and learning #SQL I made a repository for practicing SQL and, most importantly, I put a dog meme in the read-me file.

### R3D20
Practicing functions string in SQL.

### R3D21
Learning #SQL string functions and selections. I didn't code as much over the weekend, but I did go to cool @JSSarajevo Meetup at @MistralTech - it was a lot of fun!

### R3D22
 Learning #SQL functions and preparing a presentation on freelancing for the next #freeCodeCamp campsite here in #Sarajevo

##R3D23
Learning #SQL data types.

##R3D24
Practiced #SQL and almost done working on a [site for a client](https://brianforbentonville.com/) client.

##R3D25
Practicing #SQL one-to-many relationships. ü§ìAll this database stuff got me thinking about that old Shakespearean dilemma, To SQL or NoSQL, that's the query - from Hamlet methinks it was.  üòù

##R3D26
Reviewing the course section on SQL joins.

##R3D27
I'm on vacation, but that's no reason to pause learning #SQL . I gave a talk on #freelancing yesterday for the 11th @freeCodeCamp #sarajevo campsite at @ACADEMY387 I wanna thank my friend @adnanrahic for talking me into it.üòÄ #meetup #freeCodeCamp #nerds

##R3D28
Continuing with Colt's SQL Udemy course, making a schema for a simplified clone of Instagram's database, this is the part when it gets fun!

##R3D29
Today I practiced #SQL and finished writing a short blog post on my presentation at the #freeCodeCamp campsite: https://ift.tt/2CEm93m

##R3D30
Went to a pretty dope #CloudNative meetup at @MOPsocial now continuing to learn #sql

##R3D32
I'm almost done with Colt's #SQL course, next up I'm thinking about starting to learn http://ASP.NET  MVC since I played around with C# and I liked it, I liked it a lot. üòÄ#Dotnet #csharp #InternationalProgrammersDay

##R3D32
Practiced #SQL a little bit and went to Sarajevo QA Crew meetup.

##R3D33
Yesterday I had a great time at the local @MSCommunityBiH  #Microsoft conference, today continuing to learn #SQL and later I might watch #DotNetConf on Channel 9.

##R3D34
Practiced #SQL and worked with a client on customizing his website a bit more.

##R3D35
I completed Colt Steel's #SQL course and learned a lot new tricks along the way, I still have a lot left to figure about relational databases. Today I'm planing to work on a client project and to start learning ASP.NET  MVC üòé#Dotnet #Csharp

##R3D36
Today I started learning ASP #Dotnet MVC, completed the first hour of the course, setup a basic project and passed the first assessment.  I'm noticing a lot of similarities with #Laravel -  after all they're are both MVC frameworks.

### R3D37
Today I learned about models and scaffolding in http://ASP.NET  MVC, having primarily used a text editors for the web previously, I'm really impressed with what Visual Studio IDE has to offer! #Dotnet #VisualStudio #Microsoft #MVC #AspNetCore

### R3D38
Worked on project for a client, watched a tutorial on productivity in Visual Studio and another one on theory in object oriented programming.  #programming #VisualStudio #Dotnet #OOP

### R3D39
 Learned about controllers in http://ASP.NET  MVC and juggled between two clients, it ain't easy, but somebody has to be a real ninja OG, ya digg.

### R3D40
Learning about views in http://ASP.NET  MVC, Razor templates seems similar to Blade templates in #Lavravel they both start with the @ sign!

### R3D41
Complete the intro http://ASP.NET  MVC course from MVA and started the The http://ASP.NET  MVC 5 Course from Mosh Hamedani on Udemy. Also wrote a short blog post about Grunt:  https://ift.tt/2xAcGVV  #DotNet #grunt #Microsoft #javascript

### R3D42
Installed a few productivity extensions for #VisualStudio so I can start the new course. Also prepared the presentation (and made sure it's full of MEMES) about #100DaysOfCode challenge for the #OpenWebSarajevo  #Meetup tomorrow.

### R3D43
 Went to a design meetup and although  designers speak a language that's alien to me, it's interesting to hear them talk nonetheless! Now I'm off to a second meetup. #OpenWebSarajevo #IXDA #worldinteractiondesignday #meetups

##R3D44
Went to @BosniaAgile #meetup about #Jira and got a nice cap.  Also wrote a blog post: https://ift.tt/2zw1tXU  about my presentation on #100DaysOfCode yesterday at the #OpenWebSarajevo meetup.  #Atlassian #Agile #webdeveloper #nerd #programming #codingchallenge #coders

##R3D45
Practiced routing in http://ASP.NET  MVC #Csharp #dotnet

##R3D46
Working on my asp #Dotnet app, I changed the plain default #Bootstrap template to Lumen so it looks nicer and cleaner. Also wrote a blog post: https://ift.tt/2OTwsm4  about the upcoming #Gutenberg editor in #WordPress

##R3D47
Coded a little and mostly chilled with podcasts. #webdev #coding #podcast #syntaxfm #programming #NerdOut #Geek

##R3D48
Practiced OOP in C#  and went a group coding interview, which a pretty new concept for me.

##R3D49
Worked on the client's site to make it faster and made 3 pull requests for #Hacktoberfest, 2 got merged so far. üòÄ#301DaysofCode #OpenSource #git #GitHub #coding #DigitalOcean #WordPress #nerd #dudesWhoCode #WebDeveloper #programming #Coders #Geek #vscode

##R3D50
Made a few more #Hacktoberfest #opensource contributions and did some #WordPress stuff for the client.  üòÄ

##R3D30
Went to a pretty dope #CloudNative meetup at @MOPsocial now continuing to learn #sql

##R3D32
I'm almost done with Colt's #SQL course, next up I'm thinking about starting to learn http://ASP.NET  MVC since I played around with C# and I liked it, I liked it a lot. üòÄ#Dotnet #csharp #InternationalProgrammersDay

##R3D51
Worked on a couple of client projects and finished 5 pull requests for #Hacktoberfest and I'll keep contributing after that.

##R3D52
Worked on projects for 3 different clients and I noticed something that put a smile on my face, in 2018 I had over 1000 commits on #GitHub! Just for comparison in 2017 I had 19 and in 2016 I had only one.

##R3D53
 Resumed the .NET MVC courses, practiced using partial views and started with the section on Entity framework, which sort of reminded  me of Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

##R3D54
Learned C# and .NET, updated and tweaked my portfolio (http://mirzasisic.com ) a little bit, made the social icons more touch-screen friendly and added a new client testimonial.  I'm not a #JavaScript #hipster but I missed working with #reactjs

##R3D55
Worked on making a landing page for a client, made a few portfolio tweaks and practiced C# on  @SoloLearn - the mobile app has much more content then the website. ü§ì#reactjs #HTML5 #javascript #CSS #php #csharp #bootstrap #github #firebase #apache #jquery

##R3D56
Finished a landing page for the client and worked on integrating a few contact and review plugins with the site, also made some fixes on a friend's portfolio: https://kemalkonakovic.github.io/KemalKonakovic  he just needs to review my pull request.  #Hacktoberfest #301DaysOfCode

##R3D57
Practiced C# and worked on client project.

##R3D58
Did some research on OctoberCMS, I plan to write a blog post about it since it's October now.

### R3D59
Done some reading about design patterns and practiced C# over the @SoloLearn app, there is a big community of nerds there so that means more opportunity for me to steal coding related hilarious memes.

### R3D60
 Playing around with @octobercms since I need a short break from WordPress (I use it a lot) and October CMS seems like a fun thing to experiment with. üòÄ #WordPress #php #OctoberCMS #CMS

### R3D61
Continued to play around with OctoberCMS, while personally I love editing template files, and having more control, I don't think clients could say the same.  It's fun for developers but not as user-friendly for non-coder as WordPress.

### R3D62
Updated a few components in my portfolio by adding a  more client testimonials, done some reading about http://ASP.NET  MVC, tried a few a coding challenges on #SoloLearn and wrote a blog about the OctoberCMS: https://ift.tt/2J2EjeP

### R3D63
Made a few more improvements to my portfolio, cleaned up the unused npm packages, removed the slider as it was muchisimo le annoying das moi and made the heading look better with a media query for smaller viewports.  #css3 #reactjs #bootstrap4 #npm #VSCode

### R3D64
Helping a client in distress is a nice thing to do, especially when they put their money where their mouth is. I don't know man, sometimes I just feel like a hero...

### R3D65
Started with Stephen Grider's  The Coding Interview Bootcamp course where he uses  Jest.js  for testing the code, which is a good thing since I want to get better at unit tests, for reasons a plenty.  #jestjs #coding #Algorithms #javascript #testing #NodeJS

##R3D66
Went to the #BosniaAgile #conference #BaDay2018  with a few colleagues and had a great time. Also practiced reversing  strings and running tests with Jest.js  #agile #Scrum #javascript #testing #codingtweet #webdeveloper #nerdy #VSCode #Algorithms #code

##R3D67
Practiced algorithms and using the debugger; statement.  Also done some research about cloud hosting.

##R3D68
Practiced checking for palindromes.  And read a few more articles on cloud computing.

##R3D69
Practiced reversing integers and put the client testimonials in my portfolio into a  6/12 grid, watched a few tutorials on test automation and I'm about to start using Jest.js with create-react app to check it out in practice.

##R3D70
Practiced checking how many times a character in a string is repeated and attended a webinar on visual regression testing.

##R3D71
Practiced FizzBuzz #Algorithm and troubleshooted some Safari-specific issues with #CSS animations. Also, I got an email that my #Hacktoberfest shirt is on it's way!

##R3D72
Listening to Metallica while practicing splitting arrays into chunks. Chunk is such a funny word,  sounds like a name for some moronic mumble rapper (i.e., Lil Chunkz).  Also, cleaned the client's WordPress site of malware.  üòá

##R3D73
Today I practiced splitting arrays. Yesterday iIwent to a #Hacktoberfest2018 meetup, there were talks about, #Git  #GitHub #Docker #ttd and lot of nerdy fun overall!

##R3D74
Practiced splitting arrays into chunks.

##R3D75
Played around with checking in #javascript if two strings are anagrams of each other and worked on some technical documentation.

##R3D76
Today I practiced the capitalization algorithm from Stephen Grider's course, made a new portfolio build, tested it and deployed it.

##R3D77
Practiced the steps algorithm, the solution using recursion seems a little scary...

##R3D78
Practiced the pyramid algorithm and watched a recording of a webinar about test automation. Also a friend of mine figured out why Thor's hammer is so heavy - it contains the ./node_modules folder!

##R3D79
Practiced  finding vowels algorithm using regular expressions - I  just forgot to tweet about it yesterday!  üò≥ Also listened to my favorite podcast - @syntaxfm üòç #podcast #webdev #syntax #syntaxfm #algorithm #coding #nerd #programming #javascript

##R3D80
The matrix spiral algorithm is stuff of nightmares...  I have no idea what's it for or what it does, allz I knwoz is that it's scary! üò± All those loops make my little brain want to explode! üß† ü§™ #BrainFart #Algorithms #programming #coding #webdevelopment

##R3D81
Watched a few videos on runtime complexity, I'm beginning to understand it to, a certain degree.  Also practiced the Fibonacci algorithm, the short (recursive) solution  is my favorite - no surprises there! #Algorithms #coding #javascript #programming #nerd

##R3D82
Learned about queue in data structures and started learning React Native, also brushed up on markdown syntax a bit to make a better ReadMe file. That markdown previewer in #vscode is really neat and useful! #coding #markdown #ReactNative #javascript #nerd

##R3D83
Worked with queues and stacks, I'm starting to understand some of the stuff, but I realize that I still need a lot more practice. Now that I think about it, coding is sort of like sex - sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't!

##R3D84
Worked with #WordPress now it's time to get back to the other stuff - practicing linked lists.

##R3D85
Finished little more then half of the linked link section of the course and watch a few #javascript tutorials.

##R3D86
Practiced linked listed data structures some more.

##R3D87
Made a landing page for a regular client and later I'll cover the lesson on generators in Grider's JS algorithms course.

##R3D88
Finished the linked lists sections of the course and up next is the section on binary trees. ü§ì Alsp, a friend @CodesNine helped me setup (lot of steps to get it running) ESLint and Prettier, so my code is  linted and prettier!

##R3D89
Practiced binary trees, made a small automated test in Selenium IDE, to check login and logout functionality and figured a solution for an issue with posts array in a WordPress theme. #javascript #php #wordpresswebsite #Selenium #Chrome #coding #Algorithms

##R3D90
I got some DigitalOcean  credits so I setup a droplet for WordPress, it's really impressive how fast it is compared to shared hosting, also practiced binary trees a bit. #javascript #digitalocean #SSH #Ubuntu #Docker #WordPress  #WebDeveloper #programming

##R3D91
Played around with binary tree and WordPress a little bit, I din't get to code as much as I usually do since das moa was le-busy very muchisimo today.

##R3D92
Practiced binary search tree inseratation - what ever that means...


##R3D93
Worked on customizing a #wordpresswebsite for a client, took a stroll and listened to the #syntaxfm podcast, later I'l practice some #javascript

##R3D94
Practiced algorithms some more and watched an interesting (theoretical) video on designing Twitter, so I recon it is appropriate to tweet about that...

##R3D95
Gave a few tips to a fellow developer on how to speed up a site and completed the Grider's algorithm course - I had a few lessons left. The course was very illuminating, I may get back to it again. #udemydeals #webdevelopment #code #Algorithms #WordPress

##R3D96
Worked on some WordPress stuff and since Grider updated his React course with a bunch of new lessons I got back to learning React.  A single bracket drove me a little crazy, it gave me an error on new line, but apart from that it's all good baby, baby.

##R3D97
Got back to learning React and spent some time setting up  PhpMyAdmin on a Ubuntu 18  in order to migrate a WP site from a crappy slow-ass shared hosting to a real OG VPS server. üòé #reactjs #Ubuntu #linux #HOSTING #javascript #wordpress #MySQL #SSH #LAMP

##R3D98
Had some trouble with setting up MySQL today but I sorted it out - issue with permissions. Configuring servers takes quite a while, now I see why people use things like images and containers to save time and preserve sanity.

##R3D99
Finally configured LAMP stack on a fresh droplet, updated name servers and edited virtual hosts for two WordPress installations. Now we'll see how they preform after I migrate the content and import the DB tables.

##R3D100
Doing some WordPress theming, hopefully later I'll find some time for React. Third round of the challenge is completed, round four here I come!
