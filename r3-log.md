## Log

### R2D1
Today I'm start round 3 of the challenge, doing some #WordPress work and starting with the Colt Steele's #SQL course on Udemy.

### R2D2
Making custom sidebars for #WordPress widgets and learning #SQL along the way.

### R2D3
Practicing #SQL

### R2D4
Working on integrating a custom slider with a #WordPress theme. Some clients tend to have very strong affinity towards sliders it would seem. Hopefully later I will find time to practice #SQL a bit as well.

### R2D5
Installing #MySQL on #Windows is not as bad as Colt Steele says, maybe because I'm a long time windows ninja power user, or more likely explanation is that growing a beard gave me super powers, who's to say! Also wrote a blog post: https://bit.ly/2vFLuUY

### R2D6
Learning #PHP and updating my #wordpresstheme

###R2D7
Practiced #WordPress and done some testing in #BrowserStack to see how will the site look on higher resolutions.

Messing around with WordPress and being happy for: TGIF

###R2D9
Continued working on a  website for a jazz artist, it seemed fitting to take a few hours off chilling in my favorite jazz bar in town.

###R2D10
 Learning #SQL Colt used a cats table as an example, followed by a hilarious meme, so I had to use a dogs table. I love dogs and I love databases. üòç

###R2D11
Working on #WordPress a little bit, not much since it's holiday, #EidMubarak to anyone celebrating!

###R2D12

###R2D13
  I got some valuable advice from a more experienced #WordPress  developer today and discovered custom posts types - they seem very useful and scalable.

###R2D14
Completed the 3rd section (creating tables and databases) of Colt's #SQL course and starting the next section - inserting data.

###R2D15
Continuing to learn #SQL

###R2D16
Fixed a few meta descriptions and keywords on a friend's website and practiced SQL, since C9 can be a little slow I just used the SQL tab in PhpMyAdmin.

###R2D17
Practiced SQL and re-took a #WordPress test (first score was 1.50 now it's 3.80) on #Upwork I noticed I learned a lot the past 3 months, knowing the correct answer is important, but understanding why it's correct is more important in my opinion.

###R2D18
Started working on a new #WordPress project, later on I will try to find some time for #SQL

###R2D19
Working on a #WordPress client project and learning #SQL I made a repository for practicing SQL and, most importantly, I put a dog meme in the read-me file.

###R2D20
Practicing functions string in SQL.

###R2D21
Learning #SQL string functions and selections. I didn't code as much over the weekend, but I did go to cool @JSSarajevo Meetup at @MistralTech - it was a lot of fun!

###R2D22

Practiced #SQL and almost done working on a [site for a client](https://brianforbentonville.com/) client.

##R2D25
Practicing #SQL one-to-many relationships. ü§ìAll this database stuff got me thinking about that old Shakespearean dilemma, To SQL or NoSQL, that's the query - from Hamlet methinks it was.  üòù

##R2D26
Reviewing the course section on SQL joins.

##R2D27
I'm on vacation, but that's no reason to pause learning #SQL . I gave a talk on #freelancing yesterday for the 11th @freeCodeCamp #sarajevo campsite at @ACADEMY387 I wanna thank my friend @adnanrahic for talking me into it.üòÄ #meetup #freeCodeCamp #nerds

##R2D28

##R2D35
I completed Colt Steel's #SQL course and learned a lot new tricks along the way, I still have a lot left to figure about relational databases. Today I'm planing to work on a client project and to start learning ASP.NET  MVC üòé#Dotnet #Csharp

##R2D36
Today I started learning ASP #Dotnet MVC, completed the first hour of the course, setup a basic project and passed the first assessment.  I'm noticing a lot of similarities with #Laravel -  after all they're are both MVC frameworks.
