The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [November 28, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

###  R5D1
First day of round 4 of #100DaysOfCode  and 301st day of #301DaysOfCode Cleaned up a #wordpresswebsite of adware, installed SSL certs on two other sites, configured CDN, also practiced React a little bit and worked on a custom WP theme, now it's time to be fat and lazy.


### R5D86
Today I was mostly reading other people's code and analyzing a user story to prepare for test case design.

### R5D87/R5D88/R5D89
Practiced automation in Java, I understand everything in courses I do but when I have to really automate something, then that's where the real "fun" starts!

### R5D91
Practiced Java and SQL, watched a course on Jira and another more theoretical course on object oriented design.

### R5D92
Practiced SQL, finished a course on Jira, I enjoyed learning more about the administration of Jira, even though in my every day use I don't do any of that, I just use it from a user's perspective. Also continued the course on OOP design.

### R5D93
Finished a course on OOP design and read a few articles on OOP best practices, also done some code reading and practiced SQL. It's hard to find time for learning but I try. ðŸ¤“

### R5D94/R5D95
Continued learning more about OOP,  which is my Achilles's heel, in the round 6, InshAllah, I will focus solely on OOP, hopefully in C#, as I like it a lot more then Java - I feel much more at home withing the Microsoft ecosystem.

### R5D96/R5D97 
 Finished a course on SOLID principles and resume the Automation in C# course from Jon Sonmez.

### R5D98
Watched a course on Linux, attended internal training on public speaking, practiced for ISTQB certification exam, download a few QA podcasts and done some minor refactoring on the small automation framework.

### R5D99/R5D100
Refactoring my tiny automation framework and finished reading a book about testing. I might take a few days break before I start the next round, but I most likely will do it - coding for an hour daily is not really a burden, I've come to enjoy it!
